# On_Board--PowerApp
Onboarding & Training Application built in PowerApps for an O365 tenant that leverages Planner, Outlook and Azure DevOps connectors leveraging a SharePoint table group as backend data source, CRUD functions managed through PA Form Controls. Modular content system allowing for team admins to manage their training content.

I developed this PowerApp to solve the business need of team or effort-specific onboarding.
While we have an enhanced onboarding platform from the HR side, this caregiver-facing tool focuses on the following:
- Pick up where HR Apps and Current Tools leave off
- Focus on first 2 weeks of work
- Customize modular role-relevant training
- Better engage & coordinate with new hire
